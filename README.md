# Elasticsearch + CloudFirestore = Elasticstore
-----------------

A pluggable integration with ElasticSearch to provide advanced content searches in Firestore.

This script can:

- monitor multiple firestore collections and add/modify/remove indexed elasticsearch data in real time
- communicates with client completely via Firebase (no elasticsearch client required, though a query builder is recommended)
- clean up old, outdated requests (WIP)

Heavily Inspired by the Realtime Database implementation (Flashlight) by the [Firebase Team](https://github.com/firebase/flashlight)


## Getting Started:
